drop is a long-term copy and paste toy.  It can be used to store static items
that are commonly piped to other programs.  drop uses a Tokyo Cabinet's B+ Tree
database as its backend.  It is overkill.  It is grandiose overkill.

Help output:

Usage: ./drop [command | key]

If only 'key' is specified, the matching data is printed to stdout.  If no
options are given, a list of keys is printed.

	a[dd]       <KEY> Add an item at KEY
	d[elete]    <KEY> Delete item at KEY
	f[ulllist]        List all keys with their associated data.
	h[elp]            Print this message.
	l[ist]            List all keys.
	xa[dd][c]   <KEY> Add and item at KEY from the X selection buffers
	xp[rint][c] <KEY> Print the data at KEY to an X selection buffer.

For xadd and xprint, the option trailing 'c' specifies the CLIPBOARD
selection buffer should be used.  Otherwise, PRIMARY is used.

The key is one word only.  If multiple words are entered, only the first is used.

drop is a long-term copy and paste toy.  It can be used to store static items
that are commonly piped to other programs.  drop uses a Tokyo Cabinet's B+ Tree
database as its backend.  It is overkill.  It is grandiose overkill.

Help output:

Usage: drop [-h] [-i] [-l] [-f database_file] [-(a|d)] [key]

If only 'key' is specified, the matching data is printed to stdout.  If no
options are given, a list of keys is printed.

	-h        Print this message.
	-a [key]  Add a value with 'key' as the key, otherwise same as -i.
	-f file   Specifies an alternate database file.
	-i        Interactive entry.
	-l        List the available keys and their values.
	-d key    Delete the entry specified by 'key'.


The key is one word only.  If multiple words are entered, only the first is used.
